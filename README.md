# The Integration of LLM in Generative AI technology with Databses
In this article, I will discuss about the latest trend of applying generative Ai technologies, such as large language models, to databases, and how this can help with the construction and implementation of databases, as well as the reletive issues brought by this latest trend. 

## Article 1
On a website called info world, an article named  [Kinetica offers its own LLM for SQL queries, citing security, privacy concerns](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3706952/kinetica-offers-its-own-llm-for-sql-queries-citing-security-privacy-concerns.html). This article discusses about the latest progress the company called Kinetica has made in building LLMs that can be applied to databases, and the relevent concerns about privacy and security brought by this progress.

In my perspective, applying LLMs to database is an exciting progress, for in database tasks, many works are repetitive and redundent, which consumes lots of time of database developers. With the help of generative AI technology, the efficiency when it comes to doing this kinds of work can be greatly improved. The major concern is the security of the data, for in order to develop LLMs, the datas are also need to be shared with AI companies, which may bring some issues about data security. But generally speaking, applying generative AI to database development is a trend for the future of this industry. 

## Article 2
Also on this website, another article called [10 ways generative AI upends the traditional database](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3703211/10-ways-generative-ai-upends-the-traditional-database.html) discusses in which ways machine learning can help to transform how we store, structure and query data. 

In my perspective, this article describes the improvements that artificial intelligence brings to database well. For using machine learning technologies, we can have an excelllent performance on tasks like data point classification, clustering and recommendation. These advantages brought by machine learning equips us with the ability to not only manage data, but exploiting more usages of data as well. Moreover, the data can be used to train machine learning models, which can be used for more down stream tasks.
